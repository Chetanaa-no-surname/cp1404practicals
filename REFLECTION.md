# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

Estimates you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
> Since each prac was a new topic i didn't learn to accurately predict the time I would need. But now after the fact, I am able to predict it better

Code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
> I unfortunately did not participate in ay code review things since I wasn't assigned someone and have no friends in this class

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
> I disliked how only during assignments do we write a code from scratch, I feel like I need more practice in that aspect only.
